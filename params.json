The config file is a YAML file that specifies\r\nthe tiers of maps and how many maps to select from each tier. It also has a\r\nfew configuration options for map-rotation itself, but those are all specified\r\nwhen you dump the config.\r\n\r\nA sample config:\r\n\r\n    ---\r\n    - tiers:\r\n      - choose: 2\r\n        maps:\r\n          - pl_goldrush\r\n          - cp_dustbowl\r\n          - pl_badwater\r\n      - choose: 1\r\n        maps:\r\n        - tc_hydro\r\n        - plr_hightower\r\n    - verbose: true\r\n\t- targetFile: /path/to/desired/mapcycle.txt\r\n\r\nThis will make a map list with three maps: two from the first tier and\r\none from the second. The `verbose` key will make map-rotation print out\r\nthe map list to STDOUT in addition to writing it to a file.\r\n  ","tagline":"Builds a new map rotation file for hl2-based games.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
